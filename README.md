# CT-project
Project using MATLAB to make a model that encodes and decodes and audio file and finally recreates it .
This project explores the simulation of a comprehensive communication model implemented in MATLAB, designed
to evaluate different digital modulation techniques.
The core objective is to convert a provided audio file into a bitstream
using an Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converter, then encode these
bits into symbols through various encoding schemes based on
the team number modulo operation. Notable encoding techniques
include 4-ary Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK), Frequency-Shift
Keying (FSK), Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK), two types of
Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK), and 16-ary Quadrature
Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM) from which we are required
to do ASK. 
Subsequent stages involve line coding, modulation,
and transmission through two types of Additive White Gaussian
Noise (AWGN) channels—one memoryless and the other with
memory. Demodulation, decoding, and a detailed analysis of
the output signals, including Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Bit
Error Rate (BER), and power efficiency, are conducted to gauge
the performance of the communication system under various
noise conditions. 
This project leverages MATLAB’s robust simulation capabilities to visually and quantitatively analyze
the impact of different encoding and modulation strategies on
communication system performance, providing essential insights
into the practical applications and challenges in digital communications.
